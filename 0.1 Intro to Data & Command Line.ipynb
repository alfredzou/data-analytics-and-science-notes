    "* Extracting insights from data to inform decision making  \n",
    "* Data analytics is the blend of 4 major components: \n",
    "    1. Understanding the subject matter or business to ask the right question. We need to come up with hypotheses, which we will test by looking into the data. \n",
    "    2. Programming skills to clean and analyse data. While we prepare the data we need to ask ourselves the questions like 'will I be able to explore the hypothesis using this data?' and 'is this data trustworthy?'. During this process we may come up with new hypotheses through exploratory analysis of the data\n",
    "    3. Statistical know how to have the confidence the insights you found are stastically sound\n",
    "    4. Ability to communicate insights & provide recommendations to stakeholders\n",
