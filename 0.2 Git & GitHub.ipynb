    "### Git\n",
    "* Git is a version control system for local repositories, also known as file and folders\n",
    "* It allows users to make changes to the repositiories, make save points with commits, log changes and restore to previous save points\n",
    "* Each project starts with the a main branch called the origin\n",
    "* Users can create branches to test new features, then if they want to, they can merge the changes into the main branch\n",
    "* Upon merging conflicts must be resolved\n",
    "* Note Git can be used without GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "### GitHub\n",
    "* GitHub is the online equivalent of Git, or an online repository\n",
    "* It promotes collaboration by providing a location for code storage, and a platform for issues to be raised\n",
    "* GitHub also promotes open source, as most users leave their repositories public\n",
    "* Local repositories can be pushed to GitHub\n",
    "* Online repositories can be pulled from GitHub\n",
    "* Other users projects can be forked, which adds an online repository to your GitHub\n",
    "* Cloning a project, downloads a online repository to your computer (a local repository)\n",
    "* While one developer works on a main branch, at the same time another developer could create a branch to test a new feature. When this feature is complete it can then be merged with the master branch and any conflicts must be resolved\n",
    "\n",
    "### GitHub Enterprise\n",
    "* GitHub Enterprise is the commercial version of GitHub. Companies pay GitHub for their own private versions of GitHub"

    "### Git Commands\n",
    "* `git init`: turn a local folder into a local repository\n",
    "* `git status`: checks the status of a local repository. It will let you know what files are not tracked. It will let you know what files have been modified.\n",
    "* `git log`: provides the history of all commits made for this proejct. Press space to go down a page and q to quit\n",
    "* `git add file_name`: stage a file, so when you git commit it will be included in the commit\n",
    "* `git add .`: stages all files in the local repository\n",
    "* `git restore -S file_name`: unstages a file\n",
    "* `git commit -m \"log_message\"`: commit all staged files. The \"log_message\" will show in git log\n",
    "\n",
    "### Branches\n",
    "* Branches let you test out new features without effecting the master (or main) branch\n",
    "* After we are satified with it, we can merge it back into the master branch\n",
    "* `git branch`: checks existing branches\n",
    "* `git branch my_branch`: creates a new branch\n",
    "* `git checkout my_branch`: switches branches\n",
    "* to merge the branch into the master branch\n",
    "* `git checkout master`: navigate to the master branch\n",
    "* `git merge my_branch`: to merge the branch into the master branch\n",
    "* `git branch -d my_branch`: delete the branch\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Git Process:\n",
    "1. git init: initiliase the folder as a local repository\n",
    "2. Make edits\n",
    "3. git add file_name: stage the files\n",
    "4. git commit -m \"log_message\": commit the file with the log message \"log_message\"\n",
    "5. git push origin master: push it onto GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "### Git with GitHub\n",
    "* To use Git with GitHub, we need to create an online repository on GitHub\n",
    "* Then we need to tell Git about the location of the online repository\n",
    "* We can get the URL from GitHub\n",
    "* `git remote add origin URL`: this tells git to associate origin with the URL\n",
    "* `git remote set-url origin new_URL`: change the url of a remote connection\n",
    "* `git remote rm origin`: delete a remote connection\n",
    "* `git push -u origin master`: this tells git to upload the local repository to GitHub under the branch, master. The -u lets you use `git push` and `git pull` without arguments, telling git to push to the URL at origin and to the branch, Master\n",
    "* `git push origin my_branch`: this tells git to upload the local repository to GitHub under the branch, my_branch.\n",
    "* `git pull`: to download GitHub repository to local repository and merge"

In this case it will generate two files id_rsa_file_name (private key that stays on your desktop) and id_rsa_file_name.pub (public key that connects with GitHub's online account.
